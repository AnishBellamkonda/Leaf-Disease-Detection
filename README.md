# Leaf-Disease-Detection

Leaf disease detection involves a systematic process that integrates filtering segmentation techniques with various machine learning algorithms, utilizing leaf images as the dataset. Initially, preprocessing methods such as Gaussian blur or median filtering are applied to enhance the quality of the leaf images and reduce noise. Segmentation techniques are then employed to isolate the leaf region from the background, enabling the extraction of pertinent features.

Following segmentation, a diverse set of features, including color histograms, texture descriptors, and shape properties, are extracted from the segmented leaf regions. These features serve as input for a range of machine learning algorithms, such as Naive Bayes, Decision Trees, Logistic Regression, MLP (Multi-Layer Perceptron), Random Forest, and K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN). Each algorithm learns patterns in the data to classify leaves as healthy or diseased based on the extracted features.

The models are trained on a labeled dataset consisting of leaf images paired with their corresponding disease labels. During training, techniques like hyperparameter tuning and cross-validation are employed to optimize the models for improved accuracy and generalization. Subsequently, the trained models are validated using a separate dataset to assess their performance.

Once validated, the models are tested on another separate dataset to evaluate their effectiveness in detecting leaf diseases. Performance metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score are computed to quantify the models' performance. Models demonstrating satisfactory performance are then deployed in real-world applications for leaf disease detection.

Continuous monitoring and updates are vital to ensure the system's reliability and effectiveness over time. By utilizing leaf images as the dataset and integrating filtering segmentation techniques with a variety of machine learning algorithms, leaf disease detection systems can provide accurate and reliable results, making them valuable tools in agriculture and crop management practices.
